👋 Hello! 
I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience from Obninsk, Russia.

My main focus in work is to make tasks accomplished no matter.
Have a great experience in solving issues in hard environments - lack of access, debugging possibilities, or knowledge.
I'm an explorer: still love to learn new languages, technologies, libraries and introduce them in real-life projects.
